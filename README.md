# Improving Multi-Class Metagenomic Contig Classification with Graph-Based Learning  
The goal of this thesis is to improve multi-class contig classification in metagenomic assemblies by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into the classification pipeline. In particular, it evaluates two strategies: using a GNN to refine existing predictions from the 4CAC system, and using a GNN as a stand-alone classifier trained directly on contig features and assembly graph structure.
